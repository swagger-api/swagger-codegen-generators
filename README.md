## Overview
**Swagger Codegen Generators** project is a set of classes and templates ([Handlebars](https://jknack.github.io/handlebars.java)) used by [Swagger Codegen 3.0.0 project](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/3.0.0) in its code generation process for a specific language or language framework. The main differents with **Swagger Codegen 2.x.x** are:

- **Handlebars as template engine:** with Handlebars feature is possible to create more logic-less templates.
- **OAS 3 support:** generator classes work with OpenAPI Specification V3.

More details about these and more differences are referenced at [https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/releases/tag/v3.0.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

### Prerequisites
You need the following installed and available in your $PATH:

* Java 8 (http://java.oracle.com)
* Apache maven 3.0.4 or greater (http://maven.apache.org/)

## How to Contribute.
Right now the templates and generators classes are migrated from  [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) **3.0.0** branch.
If you want to migrate an existing language/framework, you can follow this [guide](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/Swagger-Codegen-migration-(swagger-codegen-generators-repository)).
Also you need to keep in mind that **Handlebars** is used as the template engine. It's pretty similar to **Mustache**, but there are differences that can not be ignored. So you can follow this [guide](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/Swagger-Codegen-migration-from-Mustache-and-Handlebars-templates.) which explains steps to migrate templates from **Mustaches** to **Handlebars**.
